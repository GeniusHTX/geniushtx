* I am a first-year PhD student in [Computer Science department](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shiqing Ma](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~sm2283/).
* My research interests lie at adversarial machine learning, especially Trojan attacks and defenses on deep neural networks.
