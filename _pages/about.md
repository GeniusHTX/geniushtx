* I am a PhD student in [Computer Science department](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Shiqing Ma](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~sm2283/) and Prof. [Dimitris Metaxas](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~dnm/).
* My research interests lie at trustworthy machine learning, especially responsible GAI (generative artificial intelligence) and backdoor attacks&defenses.
